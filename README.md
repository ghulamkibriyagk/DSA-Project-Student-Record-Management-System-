# DSA-Project-Student-Record-Management-System-
# Introduction
The Student Record Management System is a C++ program that allows users to manage student records using a Doubly Linked List (DLL) data structure. This application provides the following features:

User Registration and Login
Student Data Entry
Student Record Deletion
Sorting Student Records by Roll Number
Student Record Updating
Displaying Student Records

# Features

User Registration and Login: The application allows users to register and log in to the system.
Student Data Entry: Users can add new student records, including name, roll number, section, GPA, semester, and contact number.
Student Record Deletion: Users can delete student records based on the roll number.
Sorting Student Records: The application can sort the student records in ascending order based on the roll number.
Student Record Updating: Users can update various fields of a student record, such as roll number, phone number, GPA, semester, section, and name.
Displaying Student Records: The application can display all the stored student records.

# File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

DSA project.cpp: This is the main file that contains the implementation of the Student Record Management System.
tests.txt: This is a text file used for user registration and login. It stores the username and password entered by the user during the registration process.

# File Handling
The application uses file handling to store the user's registration information. The tests.txt file is used to store the username and password entered by the user during the registration process. This file is accessed during the login process to verify the user's credentials.
Installation and Usage
